# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data using SQL

## Introduction

In this project, we work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth.

We use a Jupyter Notebook and SQL to analyze data from this database, called `factbook.db`.

- Data: [factbook.db](https://github.com/bertacv/world-factbook-SQL/blob/main/data/factbook.db)
- Notebook: [Analyzing CIA Factbook Data using SQL](https://github.com/bertacv/world-factbook-SQL/blob/main/notebooks/Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20using%20SQL.ipynb)

This it the first SQL project of the Dataquest learning program.

## Outline

This project consists of a exploratory analysis of the demographics of the world. 

It first searches for any outlier or wrong data in the database to exclude them from the analysis. Then it answers the following questions:

- Which are the average population and area?
- Which are the most densely populated countries?
- Which country has the highest growth rate?
- Which countries have the highest ratios of water to land?
